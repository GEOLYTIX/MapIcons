This directory was created on 7/11/2024 by aga.

The purpose is to use it as a demonstrative icon repository 
and to avoid noise resulting from using directories that contain markers of different purposes 
- deprecated sizes, logo overlays, templates, graphic files used outside maps. 

The svg files grouped here are pin-shaped markers ready to use as they are.

They are all of uniform size of 24px. 

They represent generic single layer shapes meant to be used in the context of global marker within a point layer.

This directory may be deleted when no longer in use by Mapp Icon Library.
